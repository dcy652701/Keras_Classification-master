Discription:<br>
    This is my first time to use GitHub and write this passage,so if i write poorly,please take care of it thanks.<br>
    I have built a database which contain some pictures.These pictures is about bus,dinosaur,elephant,flower and horse,each of them have 
 hundreds of images.I have named five folders to put these images in.<br>
    Then,I use a function which called ImageDataGenerator.The usage of this Function can refer to [here](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/)<br>
<br>How to use:
      The project contain only two python file,'Train-with-cuda.py' and 'test.py'<br>
			'Train-with-cuda.py' is the file to train the neural network and save the model<br>
			'test.py' is the file to use the model we trained to classify images.<br>
			
<br>
Attention:<br>
The accuracy is not very high,it might be some parameter isn't the best.
